The unittest framework does not support jupyter notebook. So I copy the important functions into the lstm_multivariative_multistep.py file for unit testing.

Since the machine learning code is quite different than other application
Some code with database interaction and calculation will be tested
The other function such as plotting, store data to database will not be covered in the test suite 

The function run on the airflow also cover in the test suite. However, some of the function is not able to test 
such as storing data to the database. As a reuslt, function to store the data into the database would not covered in the test suite

The airflow service is on https://162.246.157.108/airflow/admin/
